# Electricity-Grid-Anomaly-Detection
This project was part of the CMPT 318 (Special Topics in Computing Science) curriculum, where we utilized Hidden Markov Models to analyze historical behavior and existing patterns in household electricity consumption. The goal was to identify anomalous usage patterns, allowing for more accurate detection of irregularities in electricity usage.
